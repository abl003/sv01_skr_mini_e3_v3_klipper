# sv01_skr_mini_e3_v3_klipper
Klipper configuration as well as start and end gcode

I have added a Big Tree Tech SKR mini E3V3 to my sv01 and went through the process of klipperizing it so you dont have to!
NOTE: I have upgraded the extruder/hotend combo to a BIQU H2 V2s using this project to modify the x-carriage: https://www.printables.com/model/215739-vortex-system-for-biqu-h2-v2-sovol-sv01-pro
